I'm currently working as Software Engineer/SRE/Tech Lead in one of the leading payment companies in Jakarta, Indonesia. I have been working in the industry for almost 10 years. At my day-to-day work, I work closely with things related to platform engineering, kubernetes, and databases. Outside work, I love to interact with tech communities either locally and globally as Google Developer Expert for Cloud. 

I'm also a tech content creator. I have several channels where you can see my works:
